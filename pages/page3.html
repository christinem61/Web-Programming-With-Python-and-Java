            <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
            <p>
                Mark Elliot Zukerberg was born on May 14, 1984 in White Plains, 
                New Work. He grew up in Dobbs Ferry, New York and was raised in 
                a Reform Jewish household. He attend Ardsley High School and 
                excelled in his classes. He then transferred to private school 
                Phillips Exeter Academy, where he won prizes in mathematics, 
                astronomy and physics. He was captain of the fencing team. <br>
                He began using computers and writing software in middle school. 
                His father taught him Atari BASIC programming in the 1990s. 
                Zuckerberg went on to take a graduate course in the subject 
                while he was in high school. In one program, which he called 
                "ZuckNet", he created software that allowed the computers between
                the house and his father's dental office to communicate with each 
                other. It was a primitive version of AOL's Instant Messenger 
                which came out the next year. In highschool, he was very involved
                with classics and mythology. 

                Zuckerberg attended Harvard University where he studied computer
                science and psychology.

            <h2>Facebook</h2>
            <p>
                In January of 2004, Zuckerberg began writing code for a new 
                website known as "Thefacebook". On February 4, 2004, he launched
                the site from his dormitory. It started off as just a Harvard thing
                and then spread to other schools with the help of his roommate, 
                Dustin Moskovitz. His other college friends, Eduardo Saverin, 
                Andrew McCollum, and Chris Hughes helped him launch Facebook as well.
