                <p>
                    William Henry Gates III was born in Seattle, Washington on October 28, 1955.
                    At age 13, he wrote his first software program. He was always very interested 
                    in programming and computers. He was a Naitonal Merit Scholar when he graduated 
                    from Lakeside School in 1973. He got a 1590/1600 on his SAT and enrolled at Harvard. 
                    Gates dropped out of Harvard after a year so he could start his own company.

                <p>
                    Gates remained in contact with childhood friend, Paul Allen, and joined him at
                    Honeywell in the summer of 1974. When the MITS Altair 8800, a microcomputer based
                    on the Intel 8080 CPU, was released, Allen and Gates saw the opportunity to start 
                    their own software company.

                    Gates contacted MITS in 1975 to inform them that him and his team were working on
                    a BASIC interpreter for the platform. At this time, however, Allen and Gates did 
                    not have an Altair, nor had they written code for it. They just wanted to see if 
                    they could get MITS' attention. A few weeks later, they met with the MITS president, 
                    Ed Roberts and presented the Altair emultaor and BASIC interpreter they quickly 
                    created. The demonstration was in the MITS office in Albuquerque, New Mexico was a 
                    success resulting in a deal to distribute the intepreter as Altair BASIC. Allen 
                    named their partnership "Micro-Soft", a combination of "microcomputer" and "software". 
                    The first employee they hired was their high school collaborator Ric Weiland. After 
                    a year, they dropped the hyphen and it became "Microsoft". In 1976, it became its 
                    own independent company.
