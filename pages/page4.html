                His parents divorced and his mother married Cuban immigrant, Mike Bezos. He was 
                later adopted by Bezos and that is how his last name changed. He attended high
                school in Florida and was valedictorian. In 1986, he graduated from Princeton
                University with a BS in electrical engineering and computer science.

                start-up company, where he built a network for international trade. He then transition

            <p>
                In late 1993, Bezos decided to leave his job at D.E. Shaw and establish an online
                bookstore. He founded Amazon in his garage on July 5, 1994 after writing its 
                business plan on a roadtrip from NYC to Seattle. The companu was initially named
                Cadabra, but was later changed to Amazon. He took around $300k from his parents and 
                invested it into Amazon. In 1998, he diversified into the online sale of music 
                and video, and by the end of the year he expanded the company's products to 
                include a variety of consumer goods. In 2002, he launched Amazon Web Services, which compiled data from weather chammels
                and website traffic.
