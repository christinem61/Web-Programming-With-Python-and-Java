Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This website topic was selected mainly because I wanted to learn more about certain famous CEOs. It was by no means to convey a thorough analysis of their lives. I used 
Wikipedia for all the information I got and basically copied the information verbatim, just for the purpose of content for the website. I wanted to use the time to learn 
HTML/CSS and experiment with different Bootstrap components. 

index.html
	This file is the home/intro page for the website. It has its own .scss file for styles called index.scss. I use VScode so I downloaded this extension which converts
	it to a .css file (index.css) automatically. There is a navigation bar at the top right, some text for the header, and a picture carousel. I added two arrows to the
	left and right side of the carousel so it would resemble a slideshow. Each picture in the carousel is linked to their corresponding CEOs page. In the .css file, you
	can find style information for the carousel, navigation bar and body. 
page1.html
	This file is a part of the website that would ideally inform the user about Elon Musk. The same navigation bar is at the top right. There are 2 images centered on top
	and I used bootstrap to create 3 columns underneath. One of the columns just has information, another one of the columns has a table with some quick facts, and the
	last column is an unordered list with more information. Underneath this, is a link to the other sites once again. This file also has its own .scss file called 
	mystyles.scss which converts to .css file called mystyles.css automatically. In this file, you can find the styles lay out for the navigation bar, images and body. 
page2.html
	This file is a part of the website that would ideally inform the user about Bill Gates. The same navigation bar is at the top right. There are 2 images centered on top
	and some text underneath it with information on Gates. Underneath this, is a link to the other sites as well in the form of a dropdown menu. This file uses p4.scss
	for style information for navigation bar, body and images. 

page3.html
	This file is a part of the website that would ideally inform the user about Mark Zuckerberg. The same navigation bar is at the top right. There are 2 images centered 
	on top and some text underneath it with information on Zuckerberg. Underneath this, are links to the other sites. This file uses p4.scss for style information for 
	navigation bar, body and images. 

page4.html
	This file is a part of the website that would ideally inform the user about Jeff Bezos. The same navigation bar is at the top right. There are 2 images centered on top
	and some text underneath it with information on Bezos. Underneath this, are links to the other sites. This file uses p4.scss for style information for navigation bar,
	body and images.
